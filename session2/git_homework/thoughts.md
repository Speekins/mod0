# Thoughts On Success @ Turing

- Learn to ask questions: It's crucial to know how and when to ask questions. After approximately 20-30 minutes of trying and making no progress, now's the time to ask a question. When formulating your question be sure to add what you have tried, what resources you have consulted, and any code snippets or Github link to your code if pertinent.

- Learn to learn: When taking on new subject matter, try to incorporate learning techniques that will maximize your time spent studying. Space repetition has been shown to improve the brain's ability to remember material simply by spacing out study sessions. Also, active recall of material will help solidify information in memory--as opposed to simply reading over notes again & again, or highlighting text. Finally, studying in 20-30 minute increments is helpful to train in that focused & uninterrupted state, followed by about 5 minutes of diffuse learning, or the brains sort of less active state but it's still absorbing the information.
